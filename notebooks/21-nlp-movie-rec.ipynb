mackenziesmith by german intelligence all military camps in england are sealed off resulting in leaves of absences being revoked ernie williams danny kaye a most reluctant american soldier hypochondriac and talented mimic and his fellow conscript joseph praeger jesse white are thus left trapped in an allied army camp in southeast england just before they can return to the states in order to relieve his frustration ernie impersonates mackenzie during dinner in the mess hall a british officer entering the building falls for his disguise sparking the idea in praeger to use ernie as a double to get them out of the camp however praegers unfamiliarity with cars causes them to be caught before they even get out of sight of the gate guardsthe incident and ernies remarkable resemblance to mackenzie cause allied military intelligence leaders colonel somerset wilfrid hydewhite and colonel houston gregory walcott to consider recruiting ernie under threat of courtmartial as the generals political decoy in order to thwart the assassination plot after ernie is presented to mackenzie in person the general after some initial reservations agrees to the plan mackenzies life is at stake because he is the leading strategist in the upcoming invasion of the european mainland he is set to travel to invasion headquarters adopting ernies identity as his disguise and vice versa in order to deceive german high command only sergeant twickenham terence de marney mackenzies batman is made privy to the situation as he is to help ernie maintain the deceit however the most vital detail  that ernie will serve as a decoy target for german intelligence  is conveniently withheld from himunfortunately the situation gradually begins to unravel when lady margaret dana wynter mackenzies wife returns prematurely from a war bond tour in canada to inform mackenzie of her intention to divorce him having tired of his neglect of her and his womanizing as the result of ernies attempts to greet her with innocent marital affection lady margaret quickly recognizes him as an impostor and is out of necessity made familiar with the situation taking pity on ernie she tells him more private details about mackenzie which help complement his disguise however german intelligence continues its liquidation attempts which result in twickenham getting poisoned and a sniping attempt during a rallying speech to the troops prompting margaret to tell ernie the entire truth however while trying to hand in his resignation from the project ernie and margaret learn that the plane mackenzie was travelling on was shot down by the germans with all hands lost forcing ernie to carry on the charadeat a regimental party where ernie is supposed to participate the secret service intends to expose and apprehend a traitor who has been feeding information about mackenzie to the germans one of his agents is revealed to be captain patterson allan cuthbertson during the party ernie is very nearly exposed as an impostor by his usual blunders and mackenzies aggressively domineering aunt lady vivian margaret rutherford acting upon lady margarets advice he pretends to be drunk and have a fight with his wife in order to have an excuse for leaving the party early afterwards in private ernie and margaret confess that they have developed feelings for each other but then ernie receives a message that the traitor was apparently caught and that he is ordered back to headquarters on his way there he is kidnapped by captain patterson and sergeant bridget stanhope diana dors mackenzies driver and mistress as well as pattersons accompliceernie is flown to berlin and interrogated about the allied invasion plans and his german captors refuse to believe his desperate attempts to explain that he is a mere decoy forced to go along with the game he begins to blab about nonexistent invasion plots which the germans readily take for the truth once left alone ernie acquires a list of german agents in britain and facilitates his escape from german headquarters chased through the streets of berlin in the midst of a nocturnal bombing raid he keeps changing disguises on the proverbial run including a brief stint as adolf hitler and a subsequent cabaret act in a berlin nightclub as frulein lilli in the style of marlene dietrich as lolalola in the blue angel singing a mashup of the various running gag catchphrases that have been in use throughout the film in a germanicized english word salad all to the tune of the 1934 song cocktails for twofinally disguised as a pilot ernie boards a german bomber and manages to parachute out over england captured he is brought to general wiffingham rex evans a friend of mackenzies but as he reads him the names on his list ernie discovers to his dismay that wiffingham is the chief nazi infiltrator within the british secret service fortunately somerset has in the meantime figured out wiffinghams true allegiance on his own and rescues ernie before wiffingham can have him silenced by summary execution by firing squad for espionage the invasion proceeds smoothly and what appears to be mackenzie surprisingly returns from the dead only to reveal himself to margaret as ernie and the two end the film confessing their love for each other</td>\n",

selfinflicts an arm injury that she tells luca was caused in the escape so he can get medical attention for her he takes her to an abandoned house in the woods where members of the east live and one of the members doc treats her cutsarah is given two nights to recover before she must leave the squat at an elaborate dinner involving straitjackets sarah is tested and fails eexposing how selfishly she and many others live their lives sarah is caught one night when spying by the deaf eve and has a conversation in sign language with her sarah tells eve that she is an undercover agent and threatens eve with jail if she stays with the group eve leaves the next morning3 sarah is recruited to fill the missing members role on a jam which is an old fashioned term for a direct action after seeing the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical jam compounded by her growing attraction to charismatic benji alexander skarsgrd sarah gradually questions the moral underpinnings of her undercover duty4 sarah reluctantly participates in the easts next jam and comes to learn that each member of the east has been personally damaged by corporate activities for example doc has been poisoned by a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and his neurosystem is degenerating the east infiltrates a fancy party for the senior executives of the pharmaceutical company responsible for docs poisoning and puts a strong dose of the risky antibiotic into everyones champagne the east announce this action via youtube and over time one executives mind and body begin to degenerate as a side effect of the antibiotic revealing publicly the extreme risks of the druganother east member izzy ellen page is the daughter of a petrochemical ceo the group uses the fatherdaughter connection to gain intimate access to the ceo and forces him to bathe in the waterway he has been using as a toxic dumping ground this jam goes wrong when security guards arrive and shoot izzy in the back as she and the others flee back at the squat because of his poisoning docs hands tremble too much for him to perform surgery on izzy sarah offers to do it for him and he tells her what to do she manages to remove the bullet from izzys abdomen but izzy dies and is buried near the easts houseeven though sarah and benji have grown closer and sarah implores him to just disappear he insists that they go together to complete the final jam sarah refuses at first but finally gives in and the two begin a long drive during which sarah falls asleep when she awakens she realizes that benji is driving her to the hiller brood headquarters outside washington dc he reveals that he has always suspected her of being a hiller brood operative and that luca also thought this but brought her in as a test benji wants sarah to obtain a noc list of hiller brood agents all over the world which will be the easts third and final jam to watch them having successfully obtained the noc list using her cell phones memory card sarah runs into sharon in the hall she confronts sharon about the firms activities thus revealing her new allegiances sharon has sarahs cellphone confiscated as she leaves the building as hiller brood was sharing information about their activities with the fbi the easts hideout is raided and doc is arrested he sacrifices himself to ensure the getaway of the remaining members sarah tells benji she has failed to get the noc list benji reveals he means to use the list to expose publicly all the hiller brood agents since they are undercover however it is likely they could be killed sarah chooses not to go on the run with benji she and benji part at a truckstop as benji heads out of the country in truth sarah has the noc list because it was not on her phone she had swallowed the memory card instead it is clear that her time undercover with the east has changed her the film ends with an epilogue of her personally contacting her former coworkers those undercover and attempting to demonstrate what nefarious corporate crimes hiller brood clients want to protect she hopes to change each operatives mind about their undercover activities and perhaps join her in ecological activism she is paying

a double to get them out of the camp however praegers unfamiliarity with cars causes them to be caught before they even get out of sight of the gate guardsthe incident and ernies remarkable resemblance to mackenzie cause allied military intelligence leaders colonel somerset wilfrid hydewhite and colonel houston gregory walcott to consider recruiting ernie under threat of courtmartial as the generals political decoy in order to thwart the assassination plot after ernie is presented to mackenzie in person the general after some initial reservations agrees to the plan mackenzies life is at stake because he is the leading strategist in the upcoming invasion of the european mainland he is set to travel to invasion headquarters adopting ernies identity as his disguise and vice versa in order to deceive german high command only sergeant twickenham terence de marney mackenzies batman is made privy to the situation as he is to help ernie maintain the deceit however the most vital detail  that ernie will serve as a decoy target for german intelligence  is conveniently withheld from himunfortunately the situation gradually begins to unravel when lady margaret dana wynter mackenzies wife returns prematurely from a war bond tour in canada to inform mackenzie of her intention to divorce him having tired of his neglect of her and his womanizing as the result of ernies attempts to greet her with innocent marital affection lady margaret quickly recognizes him as an impostor and is out of necessity made familiar with the situation taking pity on ernie she tells him more private details about mackenzie which help complement his disguise however german intelligence continues its liquidation attempts which result in twickenham getting poisoned and a sniping attempt

list of german agents in britain and facilitates his escape from german headquarters chased through the streets of berlin in the midst of a nocturnal bombing raid he keeps changing disguises on the proverbial run including a brief stint as adolf hitler and a subsequent cabaret act in a berlin nightclub as frulein lilli in the style of marlene dietrich as lolalola in the blue angel singing a mashup of the various running gag catchphrases that have been in use throughout the film in a germanicized english word salad all to the tune of the 1934 song cocktails for twofinally disguised as a pilot ernie boards a german bomber and manages to parachute out over england captured he is brought to general wiffingham rex evans a friend of mackenzies but as he reads him the names on his list ernie discovers to his dismay that wiffingham is the chief nazi infiltrator within the british secret service fortunately somerset has in the meantime figured out wiffinghams true allegiance on his
