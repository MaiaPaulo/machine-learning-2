       "      <td>500 years ago, during their journey to the west to fetch the Buddhist scriptures, Monkey got annoyed with the constant nagging of his master, Longevity Monk, and decided to betray him. He was intercepted and subdued by Guanyin, who decided to give him a second chance after Longevity Monk pleaded for leniency and sacrificed himself.\\r\\nMonkey is reincarnated in the present as Joker, chief of a group of outlaws. Joker and his gang are attacked by two demons, Spider Woman and Bak Jing-jing, who threatened and force them to do their bidding. Joker's second-in-command (a reincarnation of Pigsy) secretly overheard the demons' plan to capture Longevity Monk and feast on his flesh to gain immortality. Joker subsequently fell in love with Bak Jing-jing. Grandpa Buddha shows up in disguise as a bunch of grapes, informs Joker about the danger he is in, and gave him a magic mirror which can reveal a being's true form.\\r\\nThe group are attacked by Bull King, who is also after Longevity Monk. Joker and Pigsy flee with Bak Jing-jing and Spider Woman to Waterfall Cave, where the two demons starts fighting over Joker. Bak Jing-jing and Joker eventually flee from the cave while Spider Woman is impregnated with Pigsy's child by accident. As Bak Jing-jing had been poisoned by Spider Woman, Joker goes back to the cave to ask for the antidote, but is imprisoned by Spider Woman. In the meantime, outside the cave, Bak Jing-jing is captured by Bull King, who cures her of the poison.\\r\\nInside the cave, Joker finds Pandora's Box, which can open up a time portal when moonlight shines on it and when \"Prajñāpāramitā\" is chanted. He also overhears Guanyin's voice, telling him that he was actually Monkey in his past life and is destined to continue his quest to escort his master on the journey to the west. His true destiny will be revealed after he gets three marks on the sole of his foot. Meanwhile, Bull King and Bak Jing-jing enters the cave and fight with Spider Woman. Bak Jing-jing commits suicide after mistakenly believing that Joker has betrayed her love and fathered a child with Spider Woman.\\r\\nJoker finds Bak Jing-jing and tries to save her by travelling back in time with the aid of Pandora's Box, but each time he arrives a few seconds too late to stop her from committing suicide. He finally manages to make it on time to prevent Bak Jing-jing from slitting her throat, but she sacrifices herself to save him from Bull King. Joker travels back in time again, but ends up going back in time by 500 years. Outside the cave, he encounters a fairy, Zixia, who confiscates Pandora's Box and sears three dots on the sole of his foot to mark him as her servant. This fulfils his true destiny as Monkey. He looks in the magic mirror given to him by Grandpa Buddha earlier and is shocked to see a reflection of himself as Monkey.\\r\\nAfter travelling back in time, Joker learns more about his past life and reunites with his master, Longevity Monk, and his fellows, Pigsy and Sandy. However, he does not want to accept his fate as Monkey because he just wants to get back Pandora's Box and return to 500 years later to save Bak Jing-jing. Zixia falls in love with him after he pulls out her sword from its scabbard because she made a promise to marry the person who can unsheathe her sword.\\r\\nZixia and Longevity Monk are captured by Bull King, who wants to take Zixia as his concubine and feast on Longevity Monk's flesh to become immortal. Pigsy and Sandy try to rescue their master but he refuses to leave unless Joker promises to fulfil his destiny. Joker goes off in search of Zixia, rescues her, and they flee from Bull King. In the ensuing fight between Joker and his companions against Bull King, Joker falls off a cliff and finds himself back in Waterfall Cave, where he meets Grandpa Buddha and Bak Jing-jing. Bak Jing-jing agrees to marry Joker initially, but she leaves later and tells him to save Zixia because she knows he's actually in love with someone else. Shortly after, Spider Woman comes to Waterfall Cave and kills everyone, including Joker. At the point of death, Joker realises the one he truly loves is Zixia.\\r\\nJoker, as a ghost, hears Guanyin's voice inside the cave again, reminding him about his destiny. He decides to accept his fate and puts on the golden circlet, therefore transforming into Monkey. He returns to the world and rushes to Bull King's city to save his master and stop Bull King's wedding ceremony with Zixia. As he is now Monkey, he must relinquish all his human desires, including love, so he tells Zixia he is not Joker and pretends to scorn her.\\r\\nMonkey and Bull King engage in battle. When Bull King realises he is losing, he uses Princess Iron Fan's magic fan to churn up strong winds that will blow the entire city towards the sun and kill everyone in the process. Monkey succeeds in stopping Bull King and saves everyone, but Zixia sacrifices herself to save him. As she dies, Monkey reveals his love for her and, as a result, his circlet tightens and causes him to feel extreme agony. In anger, he beats up Bull King before escaping together with his master, Pigsy and Sandy by using the Pandora's Box.\\r\\nMonkey wakes up later and finds himself in a cave, but with his master and fellows this time. Outside the cave, in a busy city, Monkey sees the incarnations of Joker and Zixia in a standoff on top of a wall. He uses his powers to possess Joker's body and gave Zixia a long and passionate kiss before leaving Joker's body. Joker recovered and is surprised to see himself locked in an embrace with Zixia, but accepts and continues the romance with her. They notice Monkey walking away in the crowd below and laughed at his appearance. Monkey does not turn back until outside the gates where he gave a final glance at the embracing couple and continues on the journey to the west with his companions.</td>\n",

Ken's mother, Nell (Rita Johnson), names the colt Thunderhead after the billowing white clouds she sees overhead. Ken trains Thunderhead as a race horse, but the colt suffers an injury during his first race, ending his racing career.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Albino, a wild stallion that has been raiding local ranchers' herds for years, steals Rob McLaughlin's best mares and kills Banner, putting the family near bankruptcy. The Albino is also Thunderhead's grand-sire. Rob, Ken, and the ranch hands search for the mares, but during the night, Thunderhead gets loose and runs off.\\r\\nTracking Thunderhead on foot to a secluded valley, Ken discovers the Albino's herd, including his father's horses. The Albino attacks Ken, but Thunderhead fights and kills the Albino, saving Ken's life.\\r\\nRob and the others arrive as Thunderhead rounds up the Albino's herd, heading them to the McLaughlin ranch. But once there, Thunderhead is uneasy. Rob tells Ken that Thunderhead is a king now and wants to roam his realm. Ken removes Thunderhead's halter, freeing him.</td>\n",

The Don contacts an indebted drug dealer named Pinky, who had laundered $250,000 from the Mafia that he'd subsequently loaned to Pop Byrd in-order to get the dojo built. The Don orders Pinky to either get his money back or reposes the property. Black Belt Jones (Jim Kelly), an expert martial artist and hand-for-hire, is contacted by his old friend Pop to help protect the dojo. Though Pinky intends to offer Pop to trade the building in exchange for clearing their mutual debt to the Don, he accidentally kills him during an intimidation attempt. Before he dies, Pop tells Pinky that he couldn't give them the building even if he wanted to, as it belongs not to him but his daughter Sydney. Pinky sends thugs to the dojo to try and intimidate the other employees. Though he was unable to protect his friend, Jones and the other students effortlessly fend off the thugs.\\r\\nSydney (Gloria Hendry) returns home upon hearing of her father's sudden death. She's told about his debt to the Mafia, but refuses to sell the building, instead seeking vengeance on those responsible for her father's death.. Sydney approaches Pinky’s men and ends up in a brawl, managing to overcome them due to her own martial arts training. As retaliation, Pinky kidnaps one of the students, Quincy (Eric Laneuville) and demands for them to turn over the school or give him the money. Jones and Sydney, with support from the police department, rob the Mafia and proceed to give it to Pinky, framing him for the heist. They rescue Quincy, and Pinky proceeds to send him henchmen after Jones, who has to take them on all at once. Jones and his allies manage to subdue them, and they are subsequently arrested.</td>\n",

One day in deep despair, she chooses to escape, going to a highway with the intention of throwing herself under the wheels of a bus. Instead she gets on the bus, choosing to live… and goes on to become South India’s first female taxi driver.\\r\\nWe first meet 18-year-old Selvi at a girls’ shelter in 2004 – timid, soft-spoken, a fresh runaway from a difficult life. Over a ten-year journey, we see a remarkable transformation as Selvi finds her voice and defies all expectations – learning to drive, starting her own taxi company, leading seminars to educate other women, and much more.\\r\\nThis character-driven story highlights the challenges that millions of devalued women and girls in India face. In a society where women are often considered expendable or worthless, Selvi refuses to accept this estimation for herself, moving beyond the pain she’s experienced to create an entirely new life.\\r\\nThrough Selvi’s eyes, the audience is taken on an intimate journey of healing, overcoming obstacles, and fulfilling dreams. And throughout this journey, Selvi’s unwavering spirit shines through. Wildly charming (without even realizing it), remarkably strong, and utterly courageous, by the end of the film Selvi speaks almost as a sage or our wisest teacher, sharing important, hard-won secrets about happiness and life.

       "23374  500 years ago, during their journey to the west to fetch the Buddhist scriptures, Monkey got annoyed with the constant nagging of his master, Longevity Monk, and decided to betray him. He was intercepted and subdued by Guanyin, who decided to give him a second chance after Longevity Monk pleaded for leniency and sacrificed himself.\\r\\nMonkey is reincarnated in the present as Joker, chief of a group of outlaws. Joker and his gang are attacked by two demons, Spider Woman and Bak Jing-jing, who threatened and force them to do their bidding. Joker's second-in-command (a reincarnation of Pigsy) secretly overheard the demons' plan to capture Longevity Monk and feast on his flesh to gain immortality. Joker subsequently fell in love with Bak Jing-jing. Grandpa Buddha shows up in disguise as a bunch of grapes, informs Joker about the danger he is in, and gave him a magic mirror which can reveal a being's true form.\\r\\nThe group are attacked by Bull King, who is also after Longevity Monk. Joker and Pigsy flee with Bak Jing-jing and Spider Woman to Waterfall Cave, where the two demons starts fighting over Joker. Bak Jing-jing and Joker eventually flee from the cave while Spider Woman is impregnated with Pigsy's child by accident. As Bak Jing-jing had been poisoned by Spider Woman, Joker goes back to the cave to ask for the antidote, but is imprisoned by Spider Woman. In the meantime, outside the cave, Bak Jing-jing is captured by Bull King, who cures her of the poison.\\r\\nInside the cave, Joker finds Pandora's Box, which can open up a time portal when moonlight shines on it and when \"Prajñāpāramitā\" is chanted. He also overhears Guanyin's voice, telling him that he was actually Monkey in his past life and is destined to continue his quest to escort his master on the journey to the west. His true destiny will be revealed after he gets three marks on the sole of his foot. Meanwhile, Bull King and Bak Jing-jing enters the cave and fight with Spider Woman. Bak Jing-jing commits suicide after mistakenly believing that Joker has betrayed her love and fathered a child with Spider Woman.\\r\\nJoker finds Bak Jing-jing and tries to save her by travelling back in time with the aid of Pandora's Box, but each time he arrives a few seconds too late to stop her from committing suicide. He finally manages to make it on time to prevent Bak Jing-jing from slitting her throat, but she sacrifices herself to save him from Bull King. Joker travels back in time again, but ends up going back in time by 500 years. Outside the cave, he encounters a fairy, Zixia, who confiscates Pandora's Box and sears three dots on the sole of his foot to mark him as her servant. This fulfils his true destiny as Monkey. He looks in the magic mirror given to him by Grandpa Buddha earlier and is shocked to see a reflection of himself as Monkey.\\r\\nAfter travelling back in time, Joker learns more about his past life and reunites with his master, Longevity Monk, and his fellows, Pigsy and Sandy. However, he does not want to accept his fate as Monkey because he just wants to get back Pandora's Box and return to 500 years later to save Bak Jing-jing. Zixia falls in love with him after he pulls out her sword from its scabbard because she made a promise to marry the person who can unsheathe her sword.\\r\\nZixia and Longevity Monk are captured by Bull King, who wants to take Zixia as his concubine and feast on Longevity Monk's flesh to become immortal. Pigsy and Sandy try to rescue their master but he refuses to leave unless Joker promises to fulfil his destiny. Joker goes off in search of Zixia, rescues her, and they flee from Bull King. In the ensuing fight between Joker and his companions against Bull King, Joker falls off a cliff and finds himself back in Waterfall Cave, where he meets Grandpa Buddha and Bak Jing-jing. Bak Jing-jing agrees to marry Joker initially, but she leaves later and tells him to save Zixia because she knows he's actually in love with someone else. Shortly after, Spider Woman comes to Waterfall Cave and kills everyone, including Joker. At the point of death, Joker realises the one he truly loves is Zixia.\\r\\nJoker, as a ghost, hears Guanyin's voice inside the cave again, reminding him about his destiny. He decides to accept his fate and puts on the golden circlet, therefore transforming into Monkey. He returns to the world and rushes to Bull King's city to save his master and stop Bull King's wedding ceremony with Zixia. As he is now Monkey, he must relinquish all his human desires, including love, so he tells Zixia he is not Joker and pretends to scorn her.\\r\\nMonkey and Bull King engage in battle. When Bull King realises he is losing, he uses Princess Iron Fan's magic fan to churn up strong winds that will blow the entire city towards the sun and kill everyone in the process. Monkey succeeds in stopping Bull King and saves everyone, but Zixia sacrifices herself to save him. As she dies, Monkey reveals his love for her and, as a result, his circlet tightens and causes him to feel extreme agony. In anger, he beats up Bull King before escaping together with his master, Pigsy and Sandy by using the Pandora's Box.\\r\\nMonkey wakes up later and finds himself in a cave, but with his master and fellows this time. Outside the cave, in a busy city, Monkey sees the incarnations of Joker and Zixia in a standoff on top of a wall. He uses his powers to possess Joker's body and gave Zixia a long and passionate kiss before leaving Joker's body. Joker recovered and is surprised to see himself locked in an embrace with Zixia, but accepts and continues the romance with her. They notice Monkey walking away in the crowd below and laughed at his appearance. Monkey does not turn back until outside the gates where he gave a final glance at the embracing couple and continues on the journey to the west with his companions.  \n",

Ken's mother, Nell (Rita Johnson), names the colt Thunderhead after the billowing white clouds she sees overhead. Ken trains Thunderhead as a race horse, but the colt suffers an injury during his first race, ending his racing career.\\r\\nMeanwhile, the Albino, a wild stallion that has been raiding local ranchers' herds for years, steals Rob McLaughlin's best mares and kills Banner, putting the family near bankruptcy. The Albino is also Thunderhead's grand-sire. Rob, Ken, and the ranch hands search for the mares, but during the night, Thunderhead gets loose and runs off.\\r\\nTracking Thunderhead on foot to a secluded valley, Ken discovers the Albino's herd, including his father's horses.

The Don contacts an indebted drug dealer named Pinky, who had laundered $250,000 from the Mafia that he'd subsequently loaned to Pop Byrd in-order to get the dojo built. The Don orders Pinky to either get his money back or reposes the property. Black Belt Jones (Jim Kelly), an expert martial artist and hand-for-hire, is contacted by his old friend Pop to help protect the dojo. Though Pinky intends to offer Pop to trade the building in exchange for clearing their mutual debt to the Don, he accidentally kills him during an intimidation attempt. Before he dies, Pop tells Pinky that he couldn't give them the building even if he wanted to, as it belongs not to him but his daughter Sydney. Pinky sends thugs to the dojo to try and intimidate the other employees. Though he was unable to protect his friend, Jones and the other students effortlessly fend off the thugs.\\r\\nSydney (Gloria Hendry) returns home upon hearing of her father's sudden death. She's told about his debt to the Mafia, but refuses to sell the building, instead seeking vengeance on those responsible for her father's death.. Sydney approaches Pinky’s men and ends up in a brawl, managing to overcome them due to her own martial arts training. As retaliation, Pinky kidnaps one of the students, Quincy (Eric Laneuville) and demands for them to turn over the school or give him the money. Jones and Sydney, with support from the police department, rob the Mafia and proceed to give it to Pinky, framing him for the heist. They rescue Quincy, and Pinky proceeds to send him henchmen after Jones, who has to take them on all at once. Jones and his allies manage to subdue them, and they are subsequently arrested.  \n",

detective Tom Gordon (Tom Mix) is hired to uncover the mystery. Disguised as a bandit, Tom boards the train of K & A President Cullen. Cullen's daughter, Madge, senses that Tom is not a criminal and soon falls in love with him. Madge is sought after by Burton (Carl Miller), her father's secretary, who is in league with the bandits. Tom eventually discovers his duplicity, and with the aid of Tony, his horse, rounds up the villains and wins the hand of Madge.  \n",

One day in deep despair, she chooses to escape, going to a highway with the intention of throwing herself under the wheels of a bus. Instead she gets on the bus, choosing to live… and goes on to become South India’s first female taxi driver.\\r\\nWe first meet 18-year-old Selvi at a girls’ shelter in 2004 – timid, soft-spoken, a fresh runaway from a difficult life. Over a ten-year journey, we see a remarkable transformation as Selvi finds her voice and defies all expectations – learning to drive, starting her own taxi company, leading seminars to educate other women, and much more.\\r\\nThis character-driven story highlights the challenges that millions of devalued women and girls in India face. In a society where women are often considered expendable or worthless, Selvi refuses to accept this estimation for herself, moving beyond the pain she’s experienced to create an entirely new life.\\r\\nThrough Selvi’s eyes, the audience is taken on an intimate journey of healing, overcoming obstacles, and fulfilling dreams. And throughout this journey, Selvi’s unwavering spirit shines through. Wildly charming (without even realizing it), remarkably strong, and utterly courageous, by the end of the film Selvi speaks almost as a sage or our wisest teacher, sharing important, hard-won secrets about happiness and life.

       "8791   wildlife photographer pickett smith (sam elliott) is taking photographs of the local flora and fauna as he canoes through a swamp surrounding an island containing the affluent mansion estate of the wealthy and influential crockett family. also evident throughout the swamp are numerous indicators of pollution, which pickett believes are connected to pesticide use on the island plantation. after clint crockett (adam roarke) accidentally tips over smith's canoe, he and his sister karen (joan van ark) escort smith to the family mansion where he meets the entire crockett family. the grouchy, wheelchair-bound patriarch jason (ray milland) intends on spending the next day enjoying both the 4th of july and his own birthday celebrations uninterrupted. due to the mutual dislike of the fauna around the mansion, jason sends a man named grover to spray pesticide in order to get rid of the frogs. pickett later discovers grover's corpse covered in snakebites in the swamp not far from the house. despite this warning, jason continues with his celebrations the next day.\\r\\nearly next morning, michael martindale (david gilliam) sets out to check on a possible downed telephone line. he accidentally shoots himself in the leg and is rendered immobile by strange white moss hanging down from the surrounding trees. tarantulas descend from the branches and kill him.\\r\\nback on the estate, jason's sister, iris martindale (hollis irving) sends her son, kenneth (nicholas cortland) into the greenhouse to collect flowers for a centerpiece. as he gathers the flowers, he fails to notice dozens of tokay geckos entering behind him. the geckos swarm over the stacked shelves, knocking over numerous jars of poisonous chemicals, and the resulting toxic gas asphyxiates him.\\r\\nseeing the danger posed by the animals, pickett suggests that everyone should leave the island, but jason is adamant that nothing will ruin his birthday.\\r\\nin the meantime, while chasing after a butterfly, iris is frightened by snakes and baby alligators along her path, and in a panic, falls into a swamp, where leeches latch on to her. she manages to detach a few, but fatigued, she falls down near a rattlesnake, which promptly bites and kills her. her husband, stuart (george skaff), comes looking for her, but falls into the swamp and is eaten by alligators.\\r\\non pickett's advice, charles (lance taylor, sr.) and maybelle (mae mercer) jason's long-suffering butler and cook, decide to leave, along with kenneth's fiancee, bella garrington (judy pace). clint takes them across the lake in his speedboat. clint stays behind and searches the nearby grocery store while the others walk on. a flock of birds suddenly appear as they run off behind a building. their fate is left unknown (though a strewn-open suitcase is seen later). clint discovers his boat is untethered (the culprit is a argentine black and white tegu which bites through the tether) and swims to reach it, but a cottonmouth kills him in the water. his wife, jenny (lynn borden), tries to rescue him, but gets stuck in the mud and is killed by an alligator snapping turtle.\\r\\nkaren and pickett decide to leave with clint and jenny's children, leaving jason behind as he refuses to join them. they cross the lake in pickett's canoe, encountering an alligator and water snakes, which pickett dispatches with the boat paddle and a shotgun. they eventually make it ashore and reach a road, where they hitch a ride with a woman (carolyn fitzsimmons) and her son (robert sanders). she tells them that she is heading to jefferson city and has not seen a single person or car on the road all day, while the boy shows them a huge frog he took from summer camp.\\r\\nlater that night, jason, now alone in his mansion (save for his dog, colonel), witnesses hundreds of frogs breaking into the house and staring at him. looking around the room at his stuffed animal trophies adds to his tension and he falls out of his wheelchair and collapses, apparently dead, the frogs croaking as they hop over his corpse.\\r\\nfinally, all the lights in the mansion completely flicker out.\\r\\nfollowing the end credits, an animated frog hops into frame with a human hand in its mouth, swallows it with a loud gulp, then hops out of frame.  \n",

hypochondriac and talented mimic and his fellow conscript joseph praeger jesse white are thus left trapped in an allied army camp in southeast england just before they can return to the states in order to relieve his frustration ernie impersonates mackenzie during dinner in the mess hall a british officer entering the building falls for his disguise sparking the idea in praeger to use ernie as a double to get them out of the camp however praegers unfamiliarity with cars causes them to be caught before they even get out of sight of the gate guardsthe incident and ernies remarkable resemblance to mackenzie cause allied military intelligence leaders colonel somerset wilfrid hydewhite and colonel houston gregory walcott to consider recruiting ernie under threat of courtmartial as the generals political decoy in order to thwart the assassination plot after ernie is presented to mackenzie in person the general after some initial reservations agrees to the plan mackenzies life is at stake because he is the leading strategist in the upcoming invasion of the european mainland he is set to travel to invasion headquarters adopting ernies identity as his disguise and vice versa in order to deceive german high command only sergeant twickenham terence de marney mackenzies batman is made privy to the situation as he is to help ernie maintain the deceit however the most vital detail  that ernie will serve as a decoy target for german intelligence  is conveniently withheld from himunfortunately the situation gradually begins to unravel when lady margaret dana wynter mackenzies wife returns prematurely from a war bond tour in canada to inform mackenzie of her intention to divorce him having tired of his neglect of her and his womanizing as the result of ernies attempts to greet her with innocent marital affection lady margaret quickly recognizes him as an impostor and is out of necessity made familiar with the situation taking pity on ernie she tells him more private details about mackenzie which help complement his disguise however german intelligence continues its liquidation attempts which result in twickenham getting poisoned and a sniping attempt during a rallying speech to the troops prompting margaret to tell ernie the entire truth however while trying to hand in his resignation from the project ernie and margaret learn that the plane mackenzie was travelling on was shot down by the germans with all hands lost forcing ernie to carry on the charadeat a regimental party where ernie is supposed to participate the secret service intends to expose and apprehend a traitor who has been feeding information about mackenzie to the germans one of his agents is revealed to be captain patterson allan cuthbertson during the party ernie is very nearly exposed as an impostor by his usual blunders and mackenzies aggressively domineering aunt lady vivian margaret rutherford acting upon lady margarets advice he pretends to be drunk and have a fight with his wife in order to have an excuse for leaving the party early afterwards in private ernie and margaret confess that they have developed feelings for each other but then ernie receives a message that the traitor was apparently caught and that he is ordered back to headquarters on his way there he is kidnapped by captain patterson and sergeant bridget stanhope diana dors mackenzies driver and mistress as well as pattersons accompliceernie is flown to berlin and interrogated about the allied invasion plans and his german captors refuse to believe his desperate attempts to explain that he is a mere decoy forced to go along with the game he begins to blab about nonexistent invasion plots which the germans readily take for the truth once left alone ernie acquires a list of german agents in britain and facilitates his escape from german headquarters chased through the streets of berlin in the midst of a nocturnal bombing raid he keeps changing disguises on the proverbial run including a brief stint as adolf hitler and a subsequent cabaret act in a berlin nightclub as frulein lilli in the style of marlene dietrich as lolalola in the blue angel singing a mashup of the various running gag catchphrases that have been in use throughout the film in a germanicized english word salad all to the tune of the 1934 song cocktails for twofinally disguised as a pilot ernie boards a german bomber and manages to parachute out over england captured he is brought to general wiffingham rex evans a friend of mackenzies but as he reads him the names on his list ernie discovers to his dismay that wiffingham is the chief nazi infiltrator within the british secret service fortunately somerset has in the meantime figured out wiffinghams true allegiance on his own and rescues ernie before wiffingham can have him silenced by summary execution by firing squad for espionage the invasion proceeds smoothly and what appears to be mackenzie surprisingly returns from the dead only to reveal himself to margaret as ernie and the two end the film confessing their love for each other</td>\n",

seeing the effectiveness of the pharmaceutical jam compounded by her growing attraction to charismatic benji alexander skarsgrd sarah gradually questions the moral underpinnings of her undercover duty4 sarah reluctantly participates in the easts next jam and comes to learn that each member of the east has been personally damaged by corporate activities for example doc has been poisoned by a fluoroquinolone antibiotic and his neurosystem is degenerating the east infiltrates a fancy party for the senior executives of the pharmaceutical company responsible for docs poisoning and puts a strong dose of the risky antibiotic into everyones champagne the east announce this action via youtube and over time one executives mind and body begin to degenerate as a side effect of the antibiotic revealing publicly the extreme risks of the druganother east member izzy ellen page is the daughter of a petrochemical ceo the group uses the fatherdaughter connection to gain intimate access to the ceo and forces him to bathe in the waterway he has been using as a toxic dumping ground this jam goes wrong when security guards arrive and shoot izzy in the back as she and the others flee back at the squat because of his poisoning docs hands tremble too much for him to perform surgery on izzy sarah offers to do it for him and he tells her what to do she manages to remove the bullet from izzys abdomen but izzy dies and is buried near the easts houseeven though sarah and benji have grown closer and sarah implores him to just disappear he insists that they go together to complete the final

outside washington dc he reveals that he has always suspected her of being a hiller brood operative and that luca also thought this but brought her in as a test benji wants sarah to obtain a noc list of hiller brood agents all over the world which will be the easts third and final jam to watch them having successfully obtained the noc list using her cell phones memory card sarah runs into sharon in the hall she confronts sharon about the firms activities thus revealing her new allegiances sharon has sarahs cellphone confiscated as she leaves the building as hiller brood was sharing information about their activities with the fbi the easts hideout is raided and doc is arrested he sacrifices himself to ensure the getaway of the remaining members sarah tells benji she has failed to get the noc list benji reveals he means to use the list to expose publicly all the hiller brood agents since they are undercover however it is likely they could be killed sarah chooses not to go on the run with benji she and benji part at a truckstop as benji heads out of the country in truth sarah has the noc list because it was not on her phone she had swallowed the memory card instead it is clear that her time undercover with the east has changed her the film ends with an epilogue of her personally contacting her former coworkers those undercover and attempting to demonstrate what nefarious corporate crimes hiller brood clients want to protect she hopes to change each operatives mind about their undercover activities and perhaps join her in ecological activism she is paying
